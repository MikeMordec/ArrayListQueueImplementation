# ArrayListQueueImplementation
This project provides a Java implementation of a queue data structure using ArrayLists. Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.
Features

    Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
    Dequeue: Remove and return the element at the front of the queue.
    isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
    Display: View the current state of the queue.
